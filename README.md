* Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed on the system. You can check this by using the command: ```node -v```. This command will display the version of Node.js installed on the system, if any.
* Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) globally using the command: ```npm i -g gulp```. You also can chek you gulp version using the command ```gulp -v```. This command will display the version of Gulp installed on the system.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to have the project folder located.
* Download the build using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): ```https://github.com/valmlord/gulp-starter-pack.git```.
* Navigate to the downloaded build folder: ```cd gulp-starter-pack```.
* Download the required dependencies: ```npm install``` or ```npm i```.
* To start working, enter the command: ```npm run start``` (development mode).
* To build the project, enter the command: ```npm run build``` (build mode).

If you have done everything correctly, the browser should open with the local server. The build mode involves optimizing the project: compressing images, minimizing CSS and JS files for server loading.
